                        ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ Ever since I was 5, I've always dreamt of being able to assemble a virtual application with the tip of my finger, for I was fascinated and mesmerized with every line of code others would've typed, every building block placed to make something unique and compelling. ┊͙ ˘͈ᵕ˘͈ <br>
                        ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ At the age of twelve, I began to experiment with hypervisors that would've allowed one to virtualize an operating system on the same computer without the cost of another. ┊͙ ˘͈ᵕ˘͈ <br>
                        ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ The hypervisor would've allowed one to go to lengths they couldn't imagine without harming their host operating system. ┊͙ ˘͈ᵕ˘͈ <br>
                        ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ I've always had an interest in software development, for I would wonder about the process of programming and compiling files into a functional, usable application that either served the developer's purpose or the user's. ┊͙ ˘͈ᵕ˘͈ <br>

                        ˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ To accomplish such a challenging pursuit, I began to practice a language known as python! Some of you may have heard of python already, but for those who didn't, it is simply a programming language that has been used to design applications. ┊͙ ˘͈ᵕ˘͈ <br>
