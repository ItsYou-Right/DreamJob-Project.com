(FINISHED):
Software engineering is the knowledge of software computation and virtualization. 

It is the skill that would enable one to design, invent, construct, detect, and create computer systems and applications that would either serve their purpose or solve real-life problems.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since I was 5, I've always dreamt of being able to assemble a virtual application with the tip of my finger, for I was fascinated and mesmerized with every line of code others would've typed, every building block placed to make something unique and compelling.

At the age of twelve, I began to experiment with hypervisors that would've allowed one to virtualize an operating system on the same computer without the cost of another. 

The hypervisor would've allowed one to go to lengths they couldn't imagine without harming their host operating system.

I've always had an interest in software development, for I would wonder about the process of programming and compiling files into an operational, usable application that either served the developer's purpose or the user's.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To accomplish such a challenging pursuit, I began to practice a language known as python! Some of you may have heard of python already, but for those who didn't, it is simply a programming language that has been used to design applications.

I've also taken on web designing, which is the process of constructing a fully functional website using HTML (HyperText Markup Language.) And CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 

I've been attempting the process of writing in HTML on the daily, it might've been exhausting, but delightful nonetheless! :DD

According to indeed.com, The average salary for a software engineer is $117,993 per year in the United States and $4,225 cash bonus per year. 

However, I wouldn't go as far as to ask for that much.
I'd expect to receive a fair compensation of: 55,000$-62,500$ (Median Salary) :)

Regardless of how much I'd receive, I would expect to have at least health benefits, accompanied by some other advantages that would help ease the long hours of work I'd have to apply. 

According to CareerProfiles, software engineers work a total of: Forty hours per week.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a software engineer, I'd have to work in a constantly evolving environment, due to technological advances and the strategic direction of the organization I'll work for. 

I'd create, maintain, audit, and improve systems to meet particular needs, often as advised by a systems analyst or architect, testing both hard and software systems to diagnose and resolve system faults.
